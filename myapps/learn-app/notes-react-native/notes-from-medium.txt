Here are the steps to create a React Native mobile app using the Expo CLI and then building it for iOS and Android using the EAS CLI:

Step 1: 
... Install Expo CLI ...
$ npm install -g expo-cli

✔️ Installed Expo CLI

Step 2: 
... Create a new Expo project ...
$ expo init YourAppName

✔️ Created project "YourAppName"
Replace “YourAppName” with the desired name for your application.

Step 3: 
... Navigate to the project directory ...
$ cd YourAppName

Step 4: 
... Start the development server ... 
$ expo start

✔️ Expo development server started

Step 5: 
... Make changes to the app ... 
Open the project in your preferred code editor and 
start making changes to the app’s code using React Native components.

Step 6: 
... Building for 'iOS' and 'Android' using 'EAS CLI' ... 
$ npm install -g eas-cli

✔️ Installed EAS CLI
$ eas login

✔️ Successfully authenticated
$ eas build --platform ios

✔️ Building iOS app...
$ eas build --platform android

✔️ Building Android app...

Follow the prompts and provide the necessary information 
when prompted during the build process, 
such as choosing the target device, 
providing necessary certificates, etc.

Once the build is complete, 
you will receive a URL to download the app. 
You can also find the build artifacts in the Expo EAS Build dashboard.

These are the steps 
to create a React Native app using the Expo CLI and 
then building it for iOS and Android using the EAS CLI. 

The EAS CLI provides advanced build and deployment capabilities for Expo apps, 
allowing you to customize the build process and integrate 
with continuous integration/delivery systems.
