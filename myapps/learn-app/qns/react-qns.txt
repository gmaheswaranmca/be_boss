    How react works?
    Answer:
    Composition of components.
    Components made with JSX.
    React has its Virtual DOM which will be sync with Real DOM 
        for optimizated way 
        to update the content.

    How to change data in reacts?
        State is used.
        When state changes, 
        'virtual DOM' is updated and then 
        the changes in 'virtual DOM' will be rendered to 'real DOM'.
