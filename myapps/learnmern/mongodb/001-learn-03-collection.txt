Collection
    - MongoDB stores documents in collections. 
    - Collections are analogous to tables in relational databases.

Create a Collection
    If a collection does not exist, 
    MongoDB creates the collection when you first store data for that collection.
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    > db.myNewCollection2.insertOne( { x: 1 } )
    > db.myNewCollection3.createIndex( { y: 1 } )
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Both the insertOne() and the createIndex() operations 
    create their respective collection 
    if they do not already exist.


Explicit Creation
    MongoDB provides the db.createCollection() method 
    to explicitly create a collection with various options, 
    such as setting the maximum size or the documentation validation rules. 
    
    If you are not specifying these options, 
    you do not need to explicitly create the collection 
    since MongoDB creates new collections 
    when you first store data for the collections.
