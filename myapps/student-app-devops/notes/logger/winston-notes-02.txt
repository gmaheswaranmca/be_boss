o The global module 'console' has logging methods 
    o to write Node.js program with basic debugging messages 
        - console.error(), console.warn(): 
            - prints messages to the standard error.
        - console.trace(): 
            - writes debugging messages with a stack trace to the standard error.
        - console.info(), console.log(): 
            - prints messages to the standard output
    o to debug the code quickly
    o they have lack of 
        - log levels
        - structured logging formats
        - timestamps
        - customizable output destinations
        - context-aware logging
        so, they are not suitable for production-level logging

o To address Production challenges 
  we must set up a proper logging solution 
    - Here, we invest some time
        to save time (hours) for troubleshooting and 
        analyzing issues in the future

o Let us learn the best practices for logging
